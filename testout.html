A short history of the company
</h2>
<p>
World Wide Spam was started in the summer of 2000. The business concept was to ride the dot-com wave and to make money both through bulk email and by selling canned meat online.
</p>
<p>
After receiving several complaints from customers who weren't satisfied by their bulk email, World Wide Spam altered their profile,and focused 100% on canned goods. Today, they rank as the world's 13,892nd online supplier of SPAM.
